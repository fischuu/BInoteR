### Notes
Today I presented the miRNA results to Anna, Oliver and Santeri. The bottom line is that we cannot really
say anything about the data, we see between 100k and 600k reads aligning to the mirbase db, so there are
certainly reads in the data that are miRNA origin. However, then we have about 10-15% of reads mapping uniquely,
then about 30% multimapping, which is also okay for miRNA. Then about 25% unmappable and then 25% unaligned for
other reasons. 

We currently thought, this could be due to the fragmentation of the genome or because of the hiugh repetitive
origin. The reason is often that STAR cannot find a proper seed starting point for the alignment. Here, certainly
more manual work is needed to see how to improve the mapping with that respect. 

From the unique aligned reads, about 1/3 goes to known annotation adn 2/3 goes to unannotated region, indicating
that there is still plenty of space for improvement of the annotation.

So, all in all we see miRNA signals and we see spruce origin reads, but we would need more manual curation at
this point to get more out of the data. The automatic workflow reaches the limits.


The plan is now that Anna will write to Nathaniel and asks about the new annotation and genome and sets up a
meeting in January.
