### Notes
I started to add the fold change and absolute difference into the analysis. This takes, however, way too long to run,
because the concatenation of the vector takes too long. My plan is now to
a) First run the values without names and with NA removed to get the interesting threshold and then
b) rerun the values but this time without concatenating, but just by writing out the gene names in case it hosts a SNP that belongs to 
the top 10% in fold change and top 10% in absolute difference

I did previous steps already, and fired them now on the whole dataset. However, I did it such that I take the larger fold-change and the
absolute difference, meaning this is sort of a two-sided reporting now. I will check how long it runs and then, if possible add still one
round for the good and then one round for the bad to it. Here, I need to report then also the thresholds
