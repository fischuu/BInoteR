### Notes
I adjusted the analyse eQTL script so that the percentates fir now, and each line has a unique identifed so that I can extract the genes better. Further, I also write out now genes that have at least a significatnt vairant in their cis region, so I can intersect them better.

The created figures have now also the annotation track (without gene names, though)
