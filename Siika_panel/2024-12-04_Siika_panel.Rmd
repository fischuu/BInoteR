### Notes
Carolina sent a report and a classification of the selected SNPs we handed in and I stored the files in the One Drive project folder.

A few things came to my mind while reading the report that I added as comments to the pdf.

During the meeting we were discussing a bit about the future and one thing that came up was, how Thermo Fisher is calculating the metric for diploid
and triploid loci. I was thinking that maybe, when they calculate it for diploids on triploid loci they kick out informative loci they would keep if
they are considered to be triploid. 

My suggestion was to run the metric once for diploid assumption and then once more for triploid assumption and then compare the results and identify
locations accordingly.
