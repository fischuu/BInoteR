### Notes
It seems there is something wrong with my lift-over of the population SNPs. Apparently,
a few SNPs are off by two bases which I do not understand. I suppose there is a +-1 error
when I adjust the bases, but I cannot say why this applies only to a few samples. So,
I need to look into that.

Further, we wondered with Antii and Miika, why there are a few SNPs removed from the panel
for the popuation SNPs, I asked that from Carolina, if she could explain that a bit more
detailed to me.
